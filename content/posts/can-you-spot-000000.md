I work with a UX designer who has a strong reaction every time she sees pure black (#000000) in a design. "It's too harsh!" she'll say, insisting that dark grays create more sophisticated digital experiences. Her passion got me thinking - could people actually tell the difference? That question turned into [isit000000.com](https://isit000000.com), a playful challenge that tests whether you can spot true black among various dark shades. Spoiler: it's much harder than you'd think!

Built with Vue 3 and Vite, I had the entire project—from coding to deployment—done in about 20 minutes thanks to Windsurf's streamlined workflow. The site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages with automatic deployments from GitHub. It's a fun reminder that while pure black has its place, the subtlety of dark grays often creates more sophisticated digital experiences. Try it out and see how well you can spot true black!
